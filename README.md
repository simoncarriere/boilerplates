# Boilerplates

A collection of boilerplates built with Next13, Firebase9 & Tailwind. Boilerplates with unique use cases may use external services/third party apps which will be specified in the title or description of the individual boilerplate.

### Disclaimers

- I tried to offer a balance between unopionated styling and a good starting point using a atomic design framework.
- Every boilerplate denormalizes user data into its own firebase collection 'users' on signup.

### The Boilerplates

1. Auth-SPA : Authentication for Single Page App using Email and/or Social Providers
2. Auth-Multipage (Coming Soon)
3. Auth-Subscription : Subscription Site biolerpalte, tracking subscribed / unsubscribed users on firebase.
4. Auth-Products (Coming Soon)
5. Auth-AccessControlledRooms :
