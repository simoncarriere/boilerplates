# Boilerplates

A collection of boilerplates built with Next13, Firebase 9 & Tailwind. Boilerplates with unique use cases may use external services/third party apps which will be specified in the title or description of the individual boilerplate.

### Disclaimers

- I tried to offer a balance between unopionated styling and a good starting point using a atomic design framework.
- Every boilerplate denormalizes user data into its own firebase collection 'users' on signup.

### The Boilerplates 
1. 游릭 [Auth SPA](https://github.com/simoncarriere/Auth-SPA-N13F9) : Authentication for Single Page App using Email and/or Social Providers
2. 游릭 [Paywall Subscription](https://github.com/simoncarriere/Paywall-subscription-N13F9) : Auth SPA extension with subscription paywall using Stripe
3. 游리 Auth Access Controlled Rooms :  Auth SPA extension, users can form rooms/teams and share collection data.
4. 游리 [Auth Routed](https://github.com/simoncarriere/Auth-Routed-N13F9) (Coming Soon)
5. 游댮 Auth Products (Coming Soon)
