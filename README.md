# Boilerplates

A collection of boilerplates built with Next13, Firebase 9 & Tailwind. Boilerplates with unique use cases may use external services/third party apps which will be specified in the title or description of the individual boilerplate.

### Disclaimers

- I tried to offer a balance between unopionated styling and a good starting point using a atomic design framework.
- Every boilerplate denormalizes user data into its own firebase collection 'users' on signup.
