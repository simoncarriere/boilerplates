# Boilerplates

A collection of boilerplates built with Next13, Firebase 9 & Tailwind. Boilerplates with unique use cases may use external services/third party apps which will be specified in the title or description of the individual boilerplate.

### Disclaimers

- I tried to offer a balance between unopionated styling and a good starting point using a atomic design framework.
- Every boilerplate denormalizes user data into its own firebase collection 'users' on signup.

### The Boilerplates

1. [Auth-SPA](https://github.com/simoncarriere/Auth-SPA-N13F9) : Authentication for Single Page App using Email and/or Social Providers
2. [Auth-Routed](https://github.com/simoncarriere/Auth-Routed-N13F9) (Coming Soon)
3. Auth-Subscription : Subscription Site biolerpalte, tracking subscribed / unsubscribed users on firebase.
4. Auth-Products (Coming Soon)
5. Auth-AccessControlledRooms : Authenticate users and have them form rooms with shared collection data.

### Deprecated

1. [Firebasetailwind-authboiler](https://github.com/simoncarriere/firebasetailwind-authboiler) : Multi page Auth with React, Firebase 8 and Tailwind.
